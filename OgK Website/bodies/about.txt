<h1>About OgK</h1>

<p>Ogk is the hottest new clothing line, brought to you by three teens from Victoria, BC, the west coast of Canada.</p><p> The company was founded by CEO Trevor Lainchbury and COO Naz Khedri in late 2009, with CTO Jordan Heemskerk joining in mid 2010. Starting with simple drafts and ideas, the OgK team worked extremely hard to get unusual and different clothing out, targeted towards teens and young adults. After a long and completed process of sending designs back and forth between our supplier, OgK finally got their first shipment of clothing in November of 2010.</p><p> OgK plans on revolutionizing the clothing industry and the crew is most confident that this goal will be reached in the future.</p><p> So what are we? We are Original Kuruption.
