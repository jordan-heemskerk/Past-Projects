This poker game was created while I was in highschool. I coded everything, including the graphics engine, from the ground up. I used mostly online tutorials and my own experimentation. Although many concepts I have implemented are incorrect and the application is slightly unstable, this shows my intense ability to learn, even if the original task seems insurmountable.
