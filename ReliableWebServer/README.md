This was an assignment for a networking class that I have completed.

The object of the assignment was to design a transport layer level protocol, that acts in a similar way to TCP, but much more simplified. Students were given lots of freedom in how to design this protocol. 

The protocol, called RDP, for Reliable Datagram Protocol, used UDP packets to communicate between both a host and client service, running on 2 different machines on the same LAN. 

To build: make

This is most likely a tough program to run, as it requries an extensive setup.
